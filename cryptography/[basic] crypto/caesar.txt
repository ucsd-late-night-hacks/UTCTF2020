Alright you're almost there! Now for the final (and maybe the hardest part): a
substitution cipher in the following text!

I've taken my message and replaced every alphabetic character with a correspondence
to a different character known as a "substitution cipher".

Can you find the final flag?

(Hint: We know that the flag is going to be of the format "utflag", which means
that if you see that pattern, you know what the correspondences for utflag are.
You can probably work out the remaining characters by replacing them and inferring
common words in the English language. Another great method is to use "frequency
analysis". We know that 'e' shows up most often in the alphabet, so that's probably
the most common character in the text followed by 't'. And soon, once you know a
few characters, you can infer the rest of the words based on common words that show
up in the English language.
