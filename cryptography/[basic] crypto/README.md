0. Removed all spaces from the file
1. I converted the cypto text from binary to ascii (see ascii.txt) using an
online tool.
2. I then wrote a python script (see base64decode.py) to decode from base64 back
to ascii again.
3. I then used an online Caesar cipher solver to get the next section (see
caesar.txt).
4. Lastly, I used an online substitution cipher solver to get the final text
(see final.txt)
